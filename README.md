# Titanic_dataset

This project involves predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using a machine learning model. The dataset contains information such as age, sex, class, fare, and survival status. The process includes loading and exploring the data with Pandas, visualizing it with Seaborn and Matplotlib, and identifying missing values. Data cleaning and preprocessing involve filling missing age values based on passenger class, dropping the 'Cabin' column, handling remaining missing values, and converting categorical variables to dummy variables. Unnecessary columns are dropped, and dummy variables are concatenated to the main dataframe. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is built and trained. Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score. This project demonstrates the steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a foundation for beginners in data science and machine learning.
