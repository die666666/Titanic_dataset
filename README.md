# Titanic_dataset

This project involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a machine learning model. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers, such as age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. The model's accuracy can be further improved by exploring different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and performing feature engineering.
